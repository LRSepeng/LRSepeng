✨Hi, I’m Letlhogonolo and this is a documentation of the projects I've done. As someone who learns by doing, this might show you the natural progression of both my skill and my thought process( and possibly my descent into madness). I am not naturally gifted at coding but I'm gifted with the talent for learning and there's plenty of learning to be done when it comes to becoming an expert in this field.

The Matrix sparked my interest in tech and Mr. Robot has kept the fire burning. Although the knowledge I attained was extremely captivating it was equally terrifying. I truly realized that our data is at the mercy of whomever is skilled enough to attain it.So I've taken it upon myself to learn how to spot such attacks, prevent them and hey if you can't beat them...no we must beat them for legal reasons but yes you get the point✨
