- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Letlhogonolo and this is a documentation of the projects I've done. As someone who learns by doing, this might show you the natural progression of both my skill and my thought process( and possibly my descent into madness). I am not naturally gifted at coding but I'm gifted with the talent for learning and there's plenty of learning to be done when it comes to becoming an expert in this field.

I started being interested in IT when I watched a show called Mr. Robot(and no I am not planning to be a terrorist) but I was simply intrigued and horror-stricken to find that our data is free for the taking if someone skilled in hacking chooses to make you a special conquest. I became increasingly more curious of ways to spot such attacks, prevent them and hey if you can't beat them...no we must beat them for, legal reasons but yes you get the point. I'm paranoid and thus intrigued by information security as well as cryptography and will continue to grow my knowledge base so that I can be fit to securely protect information.
